# Learning-AI-Game
Try to beat the game before the self learning AI does!

Right now this project just has an AI that has no idea what it's doing and after a couple of generations it learns what it needs to do to get as many points as possible.

The goal of this project is to have a game where the player has to race the AI to try to beat all the levels in the game, however a minimum score will be required to pass each level.
